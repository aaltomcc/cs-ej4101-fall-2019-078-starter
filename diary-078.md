why i took the course 
Although I have done software projects in the University during studies, I never focussed on Automation, CI/CD processes. Now, being in industry, I have learnt the importance. 
Hence, I decided to take this course to learn CI tools. I pretty much expected to learn tools like Jenkins and some theory behind the processes. 

"learned/learning"
I learnt md=Markdown, why we need DevOps. I got practice of writing .md files and understood relevant literature. I look forward to learn the Travis-CI and Hugo. 
Only challenging part of the course is to decide when to do the project and focus for few hours.
